# Jeff Omondi

I write code that runs.  
Sometimes it scales, sometimes it breaks — but it always improves.

I care about automation, infrastructure, clean APIs, system observability, and solving actual business problems. I’ve worked across logistics, SaaS, AI, and ERP systems. Most of my work sits quietly behind APIs, internal tools, CI/CD pipelines, or dashboards that help someone get their job done faster.

I don’t chase trends. I chase clarity, reliability, and maintainability.

### what I’m working on

- Internal developer platforms at [Greenspoon](https://greenspoon.co.ke)
- CI/CD pipelines with GitHub Actions, Jenkins, Terraform
- Warehouse tools, logistics dashboards, JIT receiving
- API integrations that don’t suck (MS Dynamics, Facebook Graph API)
- Deploying LLMs into the mess of real-world social media
